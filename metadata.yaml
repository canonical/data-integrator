summary: |
  Integrator charm for getting credentials for non-native applications.
  Not all applications implement a data_interfaces relation but allow setting
  credentials via config. Also, some of the applications are run outside of juju.
  This integrator charm allows receiving credentials which can be passed into
  application config directly without implementing juju-native relation.
