summary: |
  Integrator charm for getting database credentials for non-native applications.
  Not all applications implement a database relation interface but allow setting
  credentials via config. Also, some of the applications are run outside of juju.
  This integrator charm allows receiving credentials which can be passed into
  application config directly without implementing juju-native relation.
requires:
  mysql:
    interface: mysql_client
    limit: 1
  postgresql:
    interface: postgresql_client
    limit: 1
  mongodb:
    interface: mongodb_client
    limit: 1
