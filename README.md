# Charmed Data Integrator Operator

## Overview

This charm allows to automatically create and manage product credentials needed to authenticate with different kinds of data platform charmed products:
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/canonical/mongodb-operator)
* [MySQL](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-operator) 
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-operator)
* [Kafka](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-operator) 

It grants access to several charmed applications developed by the data-platform by handling the management of their credentials. In particular, a user can request access to a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB) or a topic (Kafka). Moreover, a user can require additional privileges by specifying extra-user-roles.

This charm enables applications or users outside Juju to connect with the desired charmed application by providing credentials and endpoints that are needed to use the desired product. 


## Config options

The supported configuration options are the following: 

database-name - `string`; The desired database name for which the access will be granted.

topic-name - `string`; The topic name for which the access is granted.

extra-user-roles - `string`; a comma-separated list of values that contains the required extra roles, e.g. `admin` in case of a database or `producer`, `consumer` in case of Kafka. 

| Product    | database-name      | topic-name         | extra-user-roles   |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| MySQL      | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :white_check_mark: |
| PostgreSQL | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :white_check_mark: |
| MongoDB    | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :white_check_mark: |
| Kafka      |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

:heavy_check_mark: -> mandatory field
:white_check_mark: -> optional field

## Usage

### Basic Usage
To deploy a unit of the Data Integrator Charm.

#### Charmhub
```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel edge
```
#### From source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/canonical/data-integrator.git
cd data-integrator/
sudo snap install charmcraft --classic
charmcraft pack
```
Then,
```shell
juju deploy ./data-integrator_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm
```

#### Configuration

If you want to require access to a database, specify the `database-name` parameter: 

```shell
juju config data-integrator database-name=test-database 
```
In addition, required `extra-user-roles` can be specified. 

```shell
juju config data-integrator database-name=test-database extra-user-roles=admin
```

Instead, for Kafka please configure the desired `topic-name`:

```shell
juju config data-integrator topic-name=test-topic extra-user-roles=producer,consumer
```

#### Relation with desidered application 

In order to related to the desired data-platform application use the following command: 

```shell
juju relate data-integrator <application>
```

After the relation has been created, the credentials and connection information can be retrieved with an action.

> **IMPORTANT** In order to change the current credentials (username and password), remove the relation with the application and establish a new one. 
When the relation is removed, the access with the previous credentials will be removed.

```shell
juju remove-relation data-integrator <application>
```

> If you need to modify `database-name`, `topic-name` or `extra-user-roles` and the relation has been already established, you need to remove the relation and then change the `database-name`, `topic-name` or `extra-user-roles`, and finally relate the data-integrator with the desidered application.

#### Retrieve credentials

In order to retrieve the credentials use the following action:

```shell
juju run-action data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```

## Tutorial

#### Relate Data Integrator with MongoDB

As first step, deploy the data-integrator charm with the : 
```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel edge --config database-name=test-database
juju deploy mongodb --channel dpe/edge
```
Wait for `watch -c juju status --relations --color` to show:

```

Relate the two applications with:
```shell
juju relate data-integrator mongodb
```
Wait for `watch -c juju status --relations --color` to show:

To retrieve information such as the username, password, and database. Enter:
```shell
juju run-action data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```
This should output something like:
```yaml

  UnitId: data-integrator/79
  id: "30"
  results:
    mongodb:
      database: test-database

```
Connect to MongoDB with  the value listed under `uris:` *(Note: your hostnames, usernames, and passwords will likely be different.)*

The same process can be done with all other products supported by the Data Platform Team.
